# Ktoż Kim? (ktozkim.pl) - Civic Watchdog Platform

A platform for documenting and exploring connections, signs of hypocrisy, and suspicions of nepotism among public figures in cities and nationwide.

## 🎉 Project Completed Successfully!

This project represents a **complete MVP implementation** of a civic watchdog platform built with modern technologies and deployed to Kubernetes. The application allows citizens to:

- Browse profiles of public officials and municipal company leaders
- Submit reports about potential conflicts of interest or nepotism
- Search and filter officials by city, position, and other criteria
- Explore documented connections between officials and companies

### Tech Stack Achievement
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite (modern, fast development)
- **Backend**: Node.js 18 + Express + TypeScript (RESTful API)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive relational schema
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes manifests successfully deployed to Minikube

### What We Built
1. **Complete Project Structure**: Organized frontend/backend with shared tooling
2. **Production-Ready API**: Authentication, officials management, reports system
3. **Responsive Web App**: Modern React interface with routing and components
4. **Database Schema**: Proper relational design with sample data
5. **Docker Ecosystem**: Optimized containers for all services
6. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Full orchestration with services, deployments, and persistence
7. **Testing & Verification**: All services running and accessible in Minikube

## Project Overview

This application serves as a civic watchdog tool where citizens can:
- View profiles of public officials, city councilors, and municipal company leaders
- Explore documented connections and relationships between officials
- Submit reports of potential conflicts of interest or nepotism
- Search and filter information by city, position, or company

## Tech Stack
